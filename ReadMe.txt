The codes are all manipulated in functions.

Every function is interconnected with themselves to make the code a working system.

The only code outside the function gives the user the option to log in
or close the app. That depends on the user's input choice of 'yes' or 'no'

The login function is actuvated when the user decides to log in. The user has to input 
correct username and password, else, the user would have to keep trying until the correct
details are used with thanks to the while loop.

Once the correct details are used, the login is successful, and the options function is activated.

In the options function, the user is shown three options one for the user to input yes to a desired option.
If the user does not pick a desired option, he would be logged out automatically.

Where the user inputs yes to create a new bank account, he would be required to supply the account name,
opening balance, account email and the account type. All of which are to be saved in the customer.txt file, and to be
used for subsequent dealings. The details in the customer txt file are cleared when a new user logs in, or the same user
decides to create a new account. Previous information would be overwritten.

An account number is also generated by the system and is stored in the customer.txt file

The user is directed to the options page again, and where he decides to check account details, he is 
required to input the generated account number which is now stored in the customer.txt file and which would enable
him to see the rest of his details.

Then the customer may choose to log out and return to the login page.
